# CFD_verification

A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver designed in fenics for coupling with festim in order to have an advection field projected onto a hydrogen transport simulation domain.

Two case studies are used for verifcation, the lid driven cavity for testing the cfd solver, and the heat driven cavity for testing buoyancy effects.

## Install Docker container
The FEniCS project provides a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/fenicsproject/stable/) with FEniCS and its dependencies (python3, UFL, DOLFIN, numpy, sympy...)  already installed. See their ["FEniCS in Docker" manual](https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/).

Get Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

Pull the Docker image and run the container, sharing a folder between the host and container:

For Windows users:
```python
docker run -ti -v ${PWD}:/home/fenics/shared --name cfd_verification quay.io/fenicsproject/stable:latest
```

## Lid driven cavity

![Lid driven cavity](LDC_problem.png)

The lid driven cavity is a simple cfd solver test case in which the top side of a cavity is given an imposed velocity condition, the location of the vorticies produced can be compared to a reference solution, in this case the reference paper is:

## Heat driven cavity

The heat driven cavity is a simple cfd solver test case in which the left and right side of a cavity is given imposed temperature conditions, velocity, temperature and pressure fields produced can be compared to a reference solution, in this case the reference paper is:
